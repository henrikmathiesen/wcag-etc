                The outmost container div has the role application, it indicates that the user is moving from widget to widget, and assistive
                technologies will adapt to that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The div with the links has the role navigation, a nav element could also been used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <cite>
                    "Be sure to use a nav element or, if using a more generic element such as a div, add a role="navigation" to every navbar to explicitly identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies." Also, the w3.org validator produces the warning: "The navigation role is unnecessary for element nav."

                There is one div with role=main, main element could also been used.
