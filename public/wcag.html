        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
      </p>

      <h2>Accessibility concerns <a id="accessibility-concerns" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#accessibility-concerns">#</a></h2>
      <p>
        It is estimated that 1/5 of the population has some sort of disibility; vision impairment, body motor impairment or cognitive
        issues. There are also "situational disabilities" like weak internet connection, a small viewing device, an old device/browser,
        bright light or a dark envirionment, and also being in a stressfull situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility is the practice of making a site or an app usable for the widest range of people. We can not assume that everybody
        uses an interface the way we do. Some people are blind or partially blind and use screen readers, some people are
        color blind, some people use only the keyboard for navigation because using a mouse is difficult for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making an interface accesable for everyone is "the right thing to do", it also helps with search enginge optimazation, and
        in some countries it is actually the law.
      </p>

      <h2>Planning for accessibility <a id="planning-for-accessibility" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#planning-for-accessibility">#</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Have it in mind from the beginning</li>
        <li>Set up goals, get everyone on the same page</li>
        <li>Put someone in charge of accessibility</li>
        <li>Evaluate tools and frameworks</li>
        <li>Do research on best practices</li>
        <li>Create different user personas</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Designing for Accessibility <a id="designing-for-accessibility" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#designing-for-accessibility">#</a></h2>

      <h3>Responsive design</h3>
      <p>
        Making apps and sites respond to different viewports is a part of accessibility. There are also other things to consider,
        like color contrast helping users in a bright envirionment and simplistic interfaces helping people in a busy envirionment.
      </p>

      <h3>Color</h3>
      <p>
        1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 woman are color blind, that means roughly 5% of the population. Color blindness is a complex matter,
        but it breaks down to people having difficulties distinguish between colors. The most common is red/green deficiencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The take away is, dont rely soley on color to convey messages and design hierchy. Complement it with text or symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also take into considoration that different display displays colors differently, for example an high quality monitor might
        distinguish our colors fine but the colors looks almost the same on a low end monitor. Also the lighting in the environment
        impacts colors. Contrast helps!
      </p>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        It is very important. The characters should be easely distinguishable but not too large. Also think about color contrast
        and contrast between bold and normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good body copy is 16-20px, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/less-mixin-for-rem-font-sizing/">but better to convert them to REM with SASS</a>,
        Zurb Foundation has such a built in mixin, rem-calc();
      </p>
      <p>
        Line length should be 45-75 characters. Line height should be about 125 procent of text size. Justified text should be avoided.
        Avoid ALL CAPS.
      </p>

      <h3>Form Design</h3>
      <p>
        Clearly communicate required fields and formats rules (do not soley rely on color). Every form field should have an assosiated
        label (label for input id), do not use placeholder as label (since its lost on focus) but placeholder can be used
        to examplifie format. Communicate errors, and again, do not soley rely on color.
      </p>

      <h3>Touch Targets</h3>
      <p>
        Design the touch target size to minimum about 45 x 45 px, so it is easy to hit with a finger tip. There should also be enough
        space between touch targets.
      </p>

      <h3>Focus and Active Indicators</h3>
      <p>
        Some users use only the keyboard for navigation, they need a clear indikator of where focus is on the page. Browsers implements
        focus indikation behavior so do not override that and do not hide the indikators with css.
      </p>

      <h3>Motion</h3>
      <p>
        Some people experience motion sickness and similar because of animations. Avoid flashy design. Could also implement a feature
        where users can turn off animations.
      </p>

      <h3>Designing for Crisis</h3>
      <p>
        Apps and sites are often designed to fit the ideal user, a happy and calm person with all the time in the world. That not
        always the case. We should design with crisis driven personas in mind. The argument is that if a person in a crisis
        sitation can navigate our site then everyone can as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Coding for Accessibility <a id="coding-for-accessibility" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#coding-for-accessibility">#</a></h2>
      <p>
        Proper code is at the heart of our accessibility efforts. Key points here are: proper semantics, dont use text as images,
        add alt attributes for images, accessible from a keyboard, performance.
      </p>
      <h3>Proper document structure</h3>
      <p>
        Use the right tag for the job. If we remove the CSS, the page should still render in an logical order and with a clear hierchy.
        h1-h6 are critical for hierchy, they show how sections relate to one another and also provide a target that screen
        readers can use to jump from section to section. h1-h6 should be used in the proper order, h3 for example should
        have a h2 parent. Unordered lists, ordered lists and description lists are also critical to the document hierchy,
        use description lists when structure for description are needed (<a href="wcag-lists.html">see list examples</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Use semantic that makes navigating the interface with a keyboard easier. For example if the interface is having a main navigation
        at the top, a side navigation at the left and main content in the middle, the tab order should be first the main
        navigation then the main content and the side navigation last.
      </p>
      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>
        Images that are used purely for design and do not communicate content to the user can be used as CSS backgrounds or give
        it, and empty alt attribute. However images in content that does communicate something to the user must be handled
        with accessibility in mind, they need to have an alt attribut that provides a description, keep the description short
        and to the point, it should communicate what the image is trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more complex images, like a diagram, we can provide a long description (longdesc="graph.txt"), the value of the attribute
        can be a text file, a link to another page or a link to a section on the same page (it is ok to hide it with display:none).
        However, the browser support longdesc is not good at this point (sep, 2015), therefor it is best to provide a plain
        old link to the long description. To do this right we need an aria attribute.
      </p>
      <h4>aria-describedby</h4>
      <p>
        <div>
          <code>
            &lt;img src="graph.jpg" aria-describedby="graph-desc" alt="Graph" /&gt;
          </code>
        </div>
        <div>
          <code>
            &lt;a href="graph-desc.html" id="graph-desc"&gt;Get Graph Details&lt;/a&gt;
          </code>
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Content</h3>
      <p>
        All your users, no mather their profile, came for your content and they should be able to get it. Place a Skip to main content
        link at the top of the page, when using audio, provide a transcript for people that have hearing issues, when using
        videos provide caption. Also dont use links out of context, dont write "Read more", instead write "Read more about
        our products", if it is crucial to the design that links say "Read more" we can insert it with a:after {content:
        "Read More"} in css and hide the "Read more about our products".
      </p>
      <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        To make our code accessible, there are some HTML attributes that we need to be aware of.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the proper language attributes for the html tag, html lang="en"</li>
        <li>If text content in another section of the page have a different language, provide lang attribute for that tag also</li>
        <li>Provide alternative text for image, as described above</li>
        <li>When using abbreviations, provide a title attribute showing the full word</li>
        <li>When using forms, use label for with a matching id</li>
        <li>When using forms, use the required attribute for required fields</li>
        <li>Use tabindex="0" if using non tabable controls like a span, 0 means tab order is in normal document flow</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="wg-child-margin-top-sm wg-margin-bottom-md">
        <div>
          <code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;...&lt;/html&gt</code>
        </div>
        <div>
          <code>&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;</code>
        </div>
        <div>
          <code>&lt;abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language"&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;</code>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><code>&lt;form&gt;</code></div>
          <div><code>&lt;label for="myform-firstname"&gt;First Name&lt;/label&gt;</code></div>
          <div><code>&lt;input type="text" id="myform-firstname" /&gt;</code></div>
          <div><code>&lt;/form&gt;</code></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Forms</h3>
      <p>
        Forms can be a little complex, but we need to make them simple and structure them in a logical order.
        We accomplish that by using fieldset and legends, labels with for attribute and inputs with id matching the for attribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the proper semantic for the type of input, for example input type="email".
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the required attribute when an input is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dont use placeholder as a replacemnt for a label. Placeholder can however be used to help the user with formatting examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add helper text where needed, dont rely on the placeholder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure that the taborder works (it should work if the form is structured in a logical way).
      </p>
      <p>
        When a label is not needed, visually, because of the context, lets say for a search bar at the top of the page, we
        still need to provide a label so users with screen readers can understand the context. We can hide the label with css.
        Use the proper CSS to hide it, do not use display:none since it will hide it from screen readers as well. Instead
        use <code class="wg-text-no-wrap">.hidden { position:absolute;left-99999px; }</code>
      </p>

      <h2>Testing, Resources and Tools <a id="testing-resources-and-tools" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#testing-resources-and-tools">#</a></h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility is about the human experience. It is ideal to test with many users that matches the personas we set up in the
        planning phase. An easy way to test for accessibility is to simply stop using a mouse. There are a number of resources
        and tools to help us make our sites and apps more accessible.
      </p>
      <h3>WCAG 2.0 from W3C</h3>
      <p>
        Intended for Web developers, Web designers, Web Editors, Content Management System developers, Web accessibility tool developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 12 guidelines devided into 4 areas (POUR): Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust. It has has 3 levels of
        compliance: A (minimum), AA (Mid-Level), AAA (Highest Level).
      </p>
      <h4>Perceivable</h4>
      <p>
        Users must be able to perceive the information. We need to provide text alternatives for any non text content. We also need
        to make the content adaptable so it can be presented in different ways, for example larger text or read by a screen
        reader. We need to think about color contrast and typography, use more than color to convey meaning, make it easy
        to see and hear content and provide audio controls for audio longer than 3 seconds.
      </p>
      <h4>Operable</h4>
      <p>
        Users must be able to operate all user interface controls. Make the interface keyboard accessible, use links and buttons
        properly, use logical form structure. Wire up propert events with JavaScript and add ARIA roles and attributes. Provide
        the user enough time to understand and use the interface. Dont cause seizures, avoid anything that flashes more than
        3 times a second. User proper semantic for heading. Add "Skip to Main Content" link. Tabable controls (links, buttons,
        form controls) should have the proper focus and active state.
      </p>
      <h4>Understandable</h4>
      <p>
        Users must be able to understand the information and user interface. Add the proper lang attribute to the HTML tag and to
        any sub section that contains a different language. Add abbreviations with title attributes so users can get the
        full meaning of the abbreviation. Make the interface appear and operate in predictible ways. Make forms easy to fill
        out and help the user with validation.
      </p>
      <h4>Robust</h4>
      <p>
        The site should work in a wide variety of browsers and assistive technoligy. Add ARIA when needed.
