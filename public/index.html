        Focus is on WCAG, following along a couple of Pluralsight courses. But we are also going to set up a little front end build
        system and repeat Foundation media queries.

      <h2>Accessibility concerns <a id="accessibility-concerns" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#accessibility-concerns">#</a></h2>
      <p>
        It is estimated that 1/5 of the population has some sort of disibility; vision impairment, body motor impairment or cognitive
        issues. There are also "situational disabilities" like weak internet connection, a small viewing device, an old device/browser,
        bright light or a dark envirionment, and also being in a stressfull situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility is the practice of making a site or an app usable for the widest range of people. We can not assume that everybody
        uses an interface the way we do. Some people are blind or partially blind and use screen readers, some people are
        color blind, some people use only the keyboard for navigation because using a mouse is difficult for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making an interface accesable for everyone is "the right thing to do", it also helps with search enginge optimazation, and
        in some countries it is actually the law.
      </p>

      <h2>Designing for Accessibility <a id="designing-for-accessibility" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#designing-for-accessibility">#</a></h2>

      <h3>Responsive design</h3>
      <p>
        Making apps and sites respond to different viewports is a part of accessibility. There are also other things to consider,
        like color contrast helping users in a bright envirionment and simplistic interfaces helping people in a busy envirionment.
      </p>

      <h3>Color</h3>
      <p>
        1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 woman are color blind, that means roughly 5% of the population. Color blindness is a complex matter,
        but it breaks down to people having difficulties distinguish between colors. The most common is red/green deficiencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The take away is, dont rely soley on color to convey messages and design hierchy. Complement it with text or symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also take into considoration that different display displays colors differently, for example an high quality monitor might
        distinguish our colors fine but the colors looks almost the same on a low end monitor. Also the lighting in the environment
        impacts colors. Contrast helps!
      </p>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>
        It is very important. The characters should be easely distinguishable but not too large. Also think about color contrast
        and contrast between bold and normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good body copy is 16-20px, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/less-mixin-for-rem-font-sizing/">but better to convert them to REM with SASS</a>,
        Zurb Foundation has such a built in mixin, rem-calc();
      </p>
      <p>
        Line length should be 45-75 characters. Line height should be about 125 procent of text size. Justified text should be avoided.
        Avoid ALL CAPS.
      </p>

      <h3>Form Design</h3>
      <p>
        Clearly communicate required fields and formats rules (do not soley rely on color). Every form field should have an assosiated
        label (label for input id), do not use placeholder as label (since its lost on focus) but placeholder can be used
        to examplifie format. Communicate errors, and again, do not soley rely on color.
      </p>

      <h3>Touch Targets</h3>
      <p>
        Design the touch target size to minimum about 45 x 45 px, so it is easy to hit with a finger tip. There should also be enough space between touch targets.
      </p>

      <h3>Focus and Active Indicators</h3>
      <p>
        Some users use only the keyboard for navigation, they need a clear indikator of where focus is on the page. Browsers implements focus indikation behavior
        so do not override that and do not hide the indikators with css.
      </p>

      <h3>Motion</h3>
      <p>
        Some people experience motion sickness and similar because of animations. Avoid flashy design. Could also implement a feature where users can turn off animations.
      </p>

      <h3>Designing for Crisis</h3>
      <p>
        Apps and sites are often designed to fit the ideal user, a happy and calm person with all the time in the world. That not always the case.
        We should design with crisis driven personas in mind. The argument is that if a person in a crisis sitation can navigate our site
        then everyone can as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proper code is at the heart of our accessibility efforts. Key points here are: proper semantics, dont use text as images,
        add alt attributes for images, accesible from a keyboard, performance.
      </p>
      <h3>Proper document structure</h3>

      <h2>Testing <a id="testing" class="wg-header-link-icon" href="#testing">#</a></h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility is about the human experience. It is ideal to test with many users that matches the personas we set up in the planning phase.
        An easy way to test for accessibility is simply stop using a mouse.
