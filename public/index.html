      <p>
        Focus is on WCAG, following along a couple of Pluralsight courses. But we are also going to set up a little front end build
        system and repeat Foundation media queries.

      <h2>Accessibility concerns</h2>
      <p>
        It is estimated that 1/5 of the population has some sort of disibility; vision impairment, body motor impairment or cognitive issues. 
        There are also "situational disabilities" like weak internet connection, a small viewing device, an old device/browser, bright light or a dark envirionment, and also being in a stressfull situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility is the practice of making a site or an app usable for the widest range of people. We can not assume that everybody uses an interface the way we do. 
        Some people are blind or partially blind and use screen readers, some people are color blind, some people use only the keyboard for navigation because using a mouse
        is difficult for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making an interface accesable for everyone is "the right thing to do", it also helps with search enginge optimazation, and in some countries it is actually the law.

      <h2>Planning for accessibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Have it in mind from the beginning</li>
        <li>Set up goals, get everyone on the same page</li>
        <li>Put someone in charge of accessibility</li>
        <li>Evaluate tools and frameworks</li>
        <li>Do research on best practices</li>
        <li>Create different user personas</li>
      </ul>
