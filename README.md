## We focus on WCAG, following along 3 Pluralsight courses:  
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/web-accessibility-getting-started  
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/web-accessibility-meeting-guidelines  
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/web-form-accessible

## Also, Foundation  
We need to get some repetition on Foundation and media queries in general, so we set that up also as a fun side thing

### Notes
In Foundation 5 we imported the individual sass files, like this:  
http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/using-sass.html

But in Foundation 6 we instead include the mixins:  
http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/sass.html#adjusting-css-output  

Imports (as I use them), can not use variables, that I dont like  
http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import
